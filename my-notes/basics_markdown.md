Place its toothpicked pit in water, watch the grisof its insides grow. Witness its populous bloom,  
honeycombed with rough  
Its cobblestones grip
the heart in its mitt, a closed fist thickened  
by complexities or cries. It is a house in which
we cannot live, the quiver on the arrow  
Flaps awkwardly, at its edges, a heron. At
its center, a wide bottom perfect with fish.
