# OBJECTS_

## What are objects?
- A way to store data
- Data structure
- Stores properties and methods
- Kay cardboard pair

Stored data can be of any type, e.g number, arrays, objects, booleans etc.

This is an object literal:

        var box = {};


#### ***Dot Notation***

This is how to assign with ***dot notation***

        box.material = "cardboard";

This is also doing the same:

        var box = {material: "cardboard"}
     

___NB: Anywhere you see a dot on JS it means you are accesing a property on an object. Everything to the left of a dot is an object.___

We use dot notation to add a property and also to access them:

    box.material //cardboard
    
***About Memory***

    var box = {};
    box.material = "cardboard";  
     
    var cb = box.material; // this will return "cardboard"  
      
    box.material = "titanium";
    cb; // will still return "cardboard" because its what  
    was still saved in memory. Variable will not reference  
    the object but memory.
 
    
#### ***Brackets Notation***   
Dots and bracket notation work similarlya s far as functionality. The syntax & rules are different.

    var box = {}; 
    box['material'] = 'cardboard'; is the same as box.material = 'cardboard'.
     
    box['material'] //will return cardboard
    

The **COOL** thing about bracket notation is that you can evaluate an expression in it unlike dot notation. An example would be:

    var boc = {};
    box.material = 'cardboard';
     
    var func = function(){
        return "material";
        };
    box[func()] //will return 'cardboard' cause the functions  
    evaluates to 'material' inside the bracket.
